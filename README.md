# Data-structure-algoritms-hacktoberfest

This repo is made for the basic learning of data structure and algorithms . 
So we need to slowly add things related to dsa .
-searching algorithms 
-sorting algorithms
-basic progamming 
-dyanamic programming 
-STL
Adding many more things which will slowly make this repo complete 
Lets make it happen together .
.
